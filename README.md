                                                     Introduction

The automotive industry is evolving rapidly, with sports cars at the forefront of innovation in speed, efficiency, and technology. My latest analysis delves into the Grand Cyber GT and its competitors, uncovering key performance metrics, market demand trends, insurance costs, and resale values.

Step 1: Pre-Analysis (Defining the Scope & Data Collection)
Before analyzing the performance of the Grand Cyber GT and other sports cars, i defined the objectives of the study. These included:

1.Evaluating car performance (speed, acceleration, handling, and fuel efficiency).
2.Analyzing market demand trends over recent years.
3.Assessing insurance costs across different regions.
4.Comparing resale value and depreciation patterns.


Data Collection & Preparation
i gathered data from multiple sources, including:

1.Performance Metrics: Top speed, acceleration (0–60 mph), horsepower, torque, weight.

2.Market Demand: Sales trends from 2018 to 2024.

3.Insurance Costs: Breakdown by country and model.

4.Resale Value: Price trends based on condition (new, used, salvage, restored).

Data Cleaning & Structuring
Removed incomplete or inconsistent entries.
Categorized cars by brand, model, drivetrain, and fuel type.
Standardized the dataset to enable direct comparisons.
Step 2: In-Analysis (Performance & Market Evaluation)
At this stage, i performed an in-depth analysis of the collected data, focusing on four key areas:

1. Speed & Acceleration Analysis
Compared 0–60 mph times, top speeds, and torque-to-weight ratios.
Examined trade-offs between acceleration and top speed based on tuning preferences.

2. Fuel Efficiency vs. Performance
I compared fuel consumption across petrol, diesel, and electric models.
Noting that high-performance models had significantly lower fuel efficiency.

3. Handling & Stability
I Evaluated cornering G-force, braking distance, and suspension setups.
Considered the impact of drivetrain configurations (AWD, RWD, FWD) on handling.

4. Market Demand & Insurance Trends
I Analyzed sales figures from 2018 to 2024, identifying peak demand years.
Examined regional insurance costs based on engine power and risk factors.





In-Analysis Insights (Key Findings & Patterns)
After conducting the analysis, i identified several key insights:

1.Acceleration vs. Top Speed Trade-Off: Some models prioritized quick acceleration over high-speed performance, especially those tuned for the track.
2.AWD Models: Had better launch control but tended to have lower top speeds due to extra weight.
3.Market Demand Trends: Sales peaked in 2022 (552 units sold), but there was a steady decline afterward.
4.Insurance Costs by Region: Asia had the highest insurance costs ($13.1M), followed by Europe ($12.9M) and the USA ($12.6M),More powerful engines & rare models had significantly higher insurance premiums.

5.Resale Value & Depreciation: Limited-production models (e.g., Lamborghini SVJ, Ferrari LaFerrari) retained value longer, High-production models depreciated faster, making rare editions more desirable.

5.Fuel Type & Efficiency: Petrol had the best fuel efficiency among high-performance sports cars, Diesel and electric options showed lower overall efficiency in extreme-performance models.





Step 3: Chart Analysis Before Dashboard Creation
Before finalizing the dashboard, I created several charts to extract key insights from the data. These visualizations helped in identifying trends, relationships, and performance metrics.

1. Car Models with the Highest Speed
Purpose: Showed which models had the highest top speeds.
Key Insight:

The M4 Competition had the highest top speed (538 km/h).
The 911 Turbo S and Chiron had lower top speeds but likely better acceleration.
AWD cars tended to have slightly lower top speeds due to added weight.

2. Fuel Type vs. Fuel Efficiency
Purpose: Compared fuel efficiency among petrol, diesel, and electric vehicles.
Key Insight:

Petrol cars had the highest fuel efficiency ($16,993.40 per unit) in performance sports cars.
Diesel models were slightly behind ($16,911.50 per unit), likely due to heavier weight.
Electric models had lower efficiency ($16,286.80 per unit) due to battery limitations in high-speed driving.

3. Country-wise Insurance Cost
Purpose: Highlighted how insurance costs varied by region.
Key Insight:

Asia had the highest insurance cost ($13.1M), followed by Europe ($12.9M) and USA ($12.6M).
This trend could be due to higher import taxes, repair costs, or performance risks.

4. Market Demand (2018–2024)
Purpose: Showed annual demand trends for sports cars.
Key Insight:

The highest demand was in 2022 (552 units sold).
A decline followed in 2023 and 2024, possibly due to rising costs, EV adoption, or economic factors.

5. Top 5 Production Units of Different Brands
Purpose: Displayed which brands produced the most sports cars.
Key Insight:

Aston Martin led production ($14.9M units), followed by Chevrolet, Porsche, Bugatti, and Ferrari.
Porsche had a high production value but slightly fewer total units than Aston Martin.

6. Top 6 Car Models (Market Value)
Purpose: Showed which models had the highest valuation in the market.
Key Insight:

The GT-R had the highest valuation ($14.9M).
M4 Competition and Huracan closely followed, indicating demand for performance-oriented cars.
The 911 Turbo S had the lowest valuation ($12.8M), suggesting higher depreciation.

7. Car Condition & Value
Purpose: Compared the value of new, used, salvage, and restored cars.
Key Insight:

New cars had the highest value ($31.3K), while used cars were still valuable ($22.4K).
Salvage cars lost significant value ($6K), while restored cars had the lowest market value ($1.5K).

Step 4: Dashboard Creation (Visualizing Insights)
To make the data easy to interpret, I created a dashboard that displayed:

1. Speed & Acceleration Comparisons (fastest models vs. best acceleration).
2. Market Demand Trends Over Time (sales data from 2018–2024).
3. Insurance Costs by Region (Asia, Europe, USA).
4. Top-Selling & Most Valuable Car Models (based on resale value & production numbers).
5. Fuel Efficiency vs. Performance Trade-Offs (how power impacts fuel use).
